# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

This document provides a comprehensive outline of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the project. It is designed to ensure a clear and structured development process. The key sections of this document include:

## Use Cases
Detailed use cases are provided to describe the interactions between users and the system. These use cases outline the functionality and expected behavior from a userâ€™s perspective.

## Data Dictionaries
A data dictionary is included to define the structure, data types, and descriptions of all relevant data elements used within the system. This ensures consistency and clarity in the management of system data.

## Flow Diagrams
Flow diagrams are used to visually represent the process flows within the system. These diagrams provide a clear view of system operations, helping developers understand how different components interact and function.
